Fundamental machine learning experiments and notes

This repository contains a collection of small experiments and notebooks
created to strengthen my understanding of core machine learning concepts.

The focus of this repository is not on building complex models,
but on clearly understanding the fundamentals behind them.

I am currently a Master's student in Deep Learning, and this repository
is part of my learning process alongside my coursework.
### Topics covered
- Logistic Regression (initial experiment)

This repository is actively being developed alongside my Master's studies.
